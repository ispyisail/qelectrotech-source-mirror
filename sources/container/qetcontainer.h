/**
	@brief The QetContainer namespace
	Splits a project document into the parts of a .qetz file and joins
	them back:

	  mimetype                 first, stored
	  manifest.xml             format and oldest format allowed to read it
	  project.xml              the project, each part replaced by
	                           <qetz-part file="..."/>
	  folios/<uuid>.xml        one per folio
	  elements/.../<name>      the project's symbol definitions
	  titleblocks/<name>.titleblock
	  images/<sha256>.png      folio pictures, once each, not base64

	join(split(d)) is d. Nothing here knows what the parts mean: the
	project is read and written by the same code as a .qet file.
